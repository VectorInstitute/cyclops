Pre-commit hooks
----------------

Once the python virtual environment is setup, you can run pre-commit
hooks using:

.. code:: bash

   pre-commit run --all-files

Coding guidelines
-----------------

For code style, we recommend the `google style
guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`__.

Pre-commit hooks apply the
`black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html>`__
code formatting.

For docstrings we use `numpy
format <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__.

We also use `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__ and
`pylint <https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/stable/>`__ for further static code
analysis. The pre-commit hooks show errors which you need to fix before
submitting a PR.

Last but not the least, we use type hints in our code which is then
checked using `mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.
Currently, mypy checks are not strict, but will be enforced more as the
API code becomes more stable.
