Report
======

Once you have trained your model and calculated the evaluation metrics, you may need to generate a comprehensive report for the used dataset, model, and visual aids to better understand how the model performs. 

Key capabilities:

    * Visual aids: Easily populate your report with the figures you have generated. Furthermore, it provides visual aids for all users to learn about how the model is performing -regardless of machine learning knowledge.

    * Model details: Document all the model details and parameters for users.

    * Interactive plots: Get an overview of how your model is performing for each subgroup over the time. It also supports user interactions to select the target subgroup and add or remove metrics.
