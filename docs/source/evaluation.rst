Evaluation
==========

The Evaluation API equips you with a rich toolbox to assess your models across key
dimensions. Dive into detailed performance metrics, unveil potential fairness
concerns, and gain granular insights through data slicing.

Key capabilities:

    * Performance: Employ a robust selection of common metrics to evaluate your
      model's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
    * Fairness: Uncover and analyze potential biases within your model to ensure
      responsible and equitable outcomes.
    * Data slicing: Isolate the model's behavior on specific subsets of your
      data, revealing performance nuances across demographics, features, or other
      important characteristics.
