What is CyclOps?
================

CyclOps is an open-source toolkit for scientists, engineers, and clinicians working
in the intersection of artificial intelligence and health.

The toolkit is designed to help researchers and practitioners to adopt
`Vector Institute's AI trust and safety principles <https://vectorinstitute.ai/ai-trust-and-safety-principles/>`__. Specifically, the toolkit focuses on evaluation and monitoring of AI systems
developed for clinical applications where robustness, safety, and fairness are critical.

The primary goal of CyclOps is to improve transparency, accountability, and trust in
AI systems that are developed for clinical applications.
