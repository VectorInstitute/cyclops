``cyclops`` is a framework for facilitating research and deployment of
ML models in the health (or clinical) setting. It provides three
high-level features:

-  Data Querying and Processing
-  Rigorous Evaluation
-  Drift Detection toolkit

``cyclops`` also provides a library of use-cases on clinical datasets.
The implemented use-cases include:

-  Mortality decompensation prediction

üê£ Getting Started
==================

Setup Python virtual environment and install dependencies
---------------------------------------------------------

The development environment has been tested on ``python = 3.9.7``.

The python virtual environment can be setup using
`poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`__. Hence, make
sure it is installed and then run:

.. code:: bash

   poetry install
   source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate

..

   ‚ö†Ô∏è ``poetry`` is the preferred installation method since it also
   installs the ``cyclops`` package, and is tested. There is also an
   ``environment.yaml`` and ``requirements.txt`` to install dependencies
   using `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__
   or `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__, however is not tested
   frequently.

=================================================================

üéì Notebooks
============

To use jupyter notebooks, the python virtual environment can be
installed and used inside an Ipython kernel. After activating the
virtual environment, run:

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name <name_of_kernel>

Now, you can navigate to the notebook‚Äôs ``Kernel`` tab and set it as
``<name_of_kernel>``.

Tutorial notebooks in ``tutorials`` can be useful to view the
functionality of the framework.
