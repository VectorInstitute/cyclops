``cyclops`` is a framework for facilitating research and deployment of ML models
in the health (or clinical) setting. It provides a few high-level APIs namely:


* `query` - Querying EHR databases (such as MIMIC-IV)
* `process` - Process static and temporal EHR data
* `evaluate` - Evaluate models on clinical prediction tasks
* `monitor` - Detect data drift relevant for clinical use cases

``cyclops`` also provides a library of use-cases on clinical datasets. The implemented
use cases include:

* Mortality decompensation prediction


## üê£ Getting Started

### Installing cyclops using pip

```bash
python3 -m pip install pycyclops
```

The core package only includes support for the `process` API. To install support for
`query`, `evaluate` and `monitor` APIs, install them as extra dependency installs.

To install with `query` API support,

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[query]'
```

To install with `evaluate` API support,

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[evaluate]'
```

To install with `monitor` API support,

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[monitor]'
```

Multiple extras could also be combined, for example to install with both `query` and
`evaluate` API support:

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[query,evaluate]'
```


## üßëüèø‚Äçüíª Developing

The development environment has been tested on ``python = 3.9``.

The python virtual environment can be set up using
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Hence, make sure it is
installed and then run:

```bash
python3 -m poetry install
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

API documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and
can be locally built by:

```bash
cd docs
make html SPHINXOPTS="-D nbsphinx_allow_errors=True"
```

### Contributing
Contributing to cyclops is welcomed.

## üìì Notebooks

To use jupyter notebooks, the python virtual environment can be installed and
used inside an IPython kernel. After activating the virtual environment, run:

```bash
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name <name_of_kernel>
```

Now, you can navigate to the notebook's ``Kernel`` tab and set it as
``<name_of_kernel>``.
