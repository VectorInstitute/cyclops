``cyclops`` is a toolkit for facilitating research and deployment of ML models for healthcare. It provides a few high-level APIs namely:

* `query` - Query EHR databases (such as MIMIC-IV)
* `data` - Create datasets for training, inference and evaluation. We use the popular ü§ó [datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) to efficiently load and slice different modalities of data.
* `models` - Use common model implementations using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
* `tasks` - Use canonical Healthcare ML tasks such as
    * Mortality prediction
    * Chest X-ray classification
* `evaluate` - Evaluate models on clinical prediction tasks
* `monitor` - Detect dataset shift relevant for clinical use cases
* `report` - Create [model report cards](https://vectorinstitute.github.io/cyclops/api/tutorials/kaggle/model_card.html) for clinical ML models

``cyclops`` also provides a library of end-to-end use cases on clinical datasets such as

* [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)
* [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.0/)
* [eICU-CRD](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/about/eicu/)


## üê£ Getting Started

### Installing cyclops using pip

```bash
python3 -m pip install pycyclops
```

The base package installation supports the use of the `data` and `process` APIs to load
and transform clinical data, for downstream tasks.

To install additional functionality from the other APIs, they can be installed as extras.

To install with `query` API support,

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[query]'
```

To install with `models`, `tasks`, `evaluate` and `monitor` API support,

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[models]'
```

To install with `report` API support,

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[report]'
```

Multiple extras could also be combined, for example to install with both `query` and
`models` support:

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'pycyclops[query,models]'
```


## üßëüèø‚Äçüíª Developing

### Using poetry

The development environment can be set up using
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Hence, make sure it is
installed and then run:

```bash
python3 -m poetry install
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

### Using Conda

The development environment can also be set up using
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Hence, make sure it is
installed and then run:

```bash
conda env create
conda install conda-build
conda develop .
```

API documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and
can be locally built by:

```bash
cd docs
make html SPHINXOPTS="-D nbsphinx_allow_errors=True"
```

### Contributing

Contributing to cyclops is welcomed.
See [Contributing](https://vectorinstitute.github.io/cyclops/api/intro.html) for
guidelines.

## üìì Notebooks

To use jupyter notebooks, the python virtual environment can be installed and
used inside an IPython kernel. After activating the virtual environment, run:

```bash
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name <name_of_kernel>
```

Now, you can navigate to the notebook's ``Kernel`` tab and set it as
``<name_of_kernel>``.
